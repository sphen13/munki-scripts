### manifest_bulk_open.sh

Simple script that takes a full path to a file containing manifest names - loops through and opens them in your default text editor.

I have exported a csv from the Mac-MSP dashboard of a bulk list of computers - passed that is (cleaned) so i can easily open up each serial numbered manifest.
