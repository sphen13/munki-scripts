## AdobeInDesignCC2018 BugFix

This applies the Adobe provided BugFix for the October 2017 release of Adobe InDesign CC 2018

This is a set of pkginfo and dmg files to be used with munki.  You may need to edit the pkginfo file for your use.  I have deployed this as an `update_for` my packaged Adobe IndDesign CC 2018 installer.
